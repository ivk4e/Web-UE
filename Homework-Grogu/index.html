            Grogu was a male Force-sensitive Mandalorian belonging to the same
            mysterious species as the legendary Grand Master Yoda. Grogu was
            born in the year 41 BBY, and was raised at the Jedi Temple on
            Coruscant as a Jedi Initiate of the Jedi Order. Grogu survived the
            Great Jedi Purge and was hidden away. Grogu was rediscovered by a
            remnant of the Galactic Empire after it fell, and became known to
            many simply as "The Child," during the New Republic Era. However
            Grogu was rescued by Din Djarin, a Mandalorian bounty hunter where
            he became a foundling. Djarin was able to find a Jedi to train him
            and he rejoined the Jedi Order under Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.
            However, Skywalker sensed that Grogu's heart was not in learning the
            Jedi path, thus he subsequently gave in to his attachment to the
            Mandalorian.
